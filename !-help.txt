                                                      Step 1: Learn a Programming Language
Before you can even get started thinking about your bot, you need to know how to program! Don't even bother looking at bot-related things yet, focus on mastering a language. What language to start with? It's your choice, although most beginners start with Python, Ruby, or Javascript.

     Step 2: Learn to use a Library
Once you already know how to program, check out the Discord API server. (If you don't know how to code yet, go back to Step 1!). Then, find a channel for the language you know. Note that this server will not teach you how to code; for questions unrelated to the library, see The Coding Den (linked in Step 1)

     Step 3: Design Features
So, your bot is running! Fantastic! But... what should it do? Start simple. Make a command that responds "pong" when the user types "ping". Work your way up from there, adding complexity and unique additions. Add whatever you like, but make sure to follow the practices linked below. If you need ideas for what to add, try joining some development servers of larger bots. Often you can see what types of features are being requested, and make your bot to fill those needs!
